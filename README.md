# Arrhythmia

This is an android mobile application project that will help people having heart issues and specifically heart arrhythmia.

* Arrhythmia

> An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm. When a heart beats too fast, the condition is called tachycardia. When a heart beats too slowly, the condition is called bradycardia.
[More details about the condition](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia)


The main idea of this project is to let users use their smartphone cameras to detect irregular heartbeats.

1. The user covers the back camera and the flashlight together.
2. We analyze the input and try to detect the heart rate first, and then if there's any abnormality.
